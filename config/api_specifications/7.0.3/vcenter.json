A Supervisor can be running on one or multiple vSphere Zones, and each vSphere Zone is associated with one or more vSphere Clusters. If a Supervisor running on the specified vSphere Cluster is running on additional vSphere Clusters, this operation will apply to Supervisor components running on the other vSphere Clusters in addition to the specified vSphere Cluster. To call this API on a Supervisor with multiple vSphere Clusters, use vcenter.namespace_management.supervisors.Topology#get to get the vSphere Clusters associated with the given Supervisor. Any cluster from the list returned can be used as the input of this API.\nif you do not have all of the privileges described as follows: \n   -  The resource vcenter.namespaces.NamespaceTemplate referenced by the parameter template requires Namespaces.SelfServiceManage. \n",

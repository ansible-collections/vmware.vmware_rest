#
# VM customization can be difficult to troubleshoot, since each environment is different. Here are some general tips:
#
# 1. Make sure perl is installed on the Linux systems. Make sure cloud-init is installed if using cloud-init
# 2. Custom script execution is disabled by default. To enable it, you can run as root: vmware-toolbox-cmd config set deployPkg enable-custom-scripts  true
# 3. VMware tools must be installed and recognized by vCenter before you can apply customization. See the example below for one approach to this.
# 4. On Linux (RHEL specifically), customization script logs can be found at /var/log/vmware-imc/toolsDeployPkg.log
# 5. Once the VM is started, the pending customization is applied. Even if that fails, the customization is then cleared. Meaning, you need to re-apply
#    the customization spec in order to try again. Simply rebooting the VM will not change anything.

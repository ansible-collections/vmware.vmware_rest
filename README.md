# Ansible Collection: vmware.vmware_rest

This repo hosts the `vmware.vmware_rest` Ansible Collection.

The **vmware.vmware_rest** collection is part of the **Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for VMware** offering that brings Ansible automation to VMware. This collection brings forward the possibility to manage vSphere resources and automate operator tasks.

This collection is based upon VMware vSphere REST API interface and does not rely on the VMware SDKs [`Pyvmomi`](https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi) and [`vSphere Automation SDK for Python`](https://github.com/vmware/vsphere-automation-sdk-python).

System programmers can enable pipelines to setup, tear down and deploy VMs while system administrators can automate time consuming repetitive tasks inevitably freeing up their time. New VMware users can find comfort in Ansible's familiarity and expedite their proficiency in record time.

### Known limitations

#### VM Template and folder structure

These modules are based on the [vSphere REST API](https://developer.vmware.com/apis/vsphere-automation/latest/). This API doesn't provide any mechanism to list or clone VM templates when they are stored in a VM folder.
To circumvent this limitation, you should store your VM templates in a [Content Library](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-254B2CE8-20A8-43F0-90E8-3F6776C2C896.html).


## Requirements

The host running the tasks must have the python requirements described in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)
Once the collection is installed, you can install them into a python environment using pip: `pip install -r ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/vmware/vmware_rest/requirements.txt`

### vSphere compatibility

The 3.0.0 version of this collection supports vSphere 7.x.
The 4.0.0 version of this collection supports vSphere 8.x.

### Ansible version compatibility

This collection has been tested against following Ansible versions: **>=2.15.0**.


## Installation

Before using this collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install vmware.vmware_rest
```

You can also include it in a requirements.yml file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```sh
collections:
  - name: vmware.vmware_rest
```

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the Ansible package.
To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install vmware.vmware_rest --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to install a different version. Use the following syntax to install version 1.0.0:

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install vmware.vmware_rest:1.0.0
```

## Support

As Red Hat Ansible [Certified Content](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/search?target_platforms=Red%20Hat%20Ansible%20Automation%20Platform), this collection is entitled to [support](https://access.redhat.com/support/) through [Ansible Automation Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible) (AAP).

If a support case cannot be opened with Red Hat and the collection has been obtained either from [Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ansible-collections/vmware.vmware_rest), there is community support available at no charge. Community support is limited to the collection; community support does not include any of the Ansible Automation Platform components or [ansible-core](https://github.com/ansible/ansible).


## Release Notes and Roadmap

A list of available releases can be found on the github [release page](https://github.com/ansible-collections/vmware.vmware_rest/releases).
A changelog may be found attached to the release, or in the [CHANGELOG.rst](CHANGELOG.rst)

Note, some collections release before an ansible-core version reaches End of Life (EOL), thus the version of ansible-core that is supported must be a version that is currently supported.
For AAP users, to see the supported ansible-core versions, review the [AAP Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/ansible-automation-platform).
For Galaxy and GitHub users, to see the supported ansible-core versions, review the [ansible-core support matrix](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html#ansible-core-support-matrix).
